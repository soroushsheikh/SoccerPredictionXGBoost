# Soccer Match Prediction using XGBoost
This notebook aims to predict the outcomes of soccer matches for the football prediction competition on Kaggle. The goal is to build a model that can effectively forecast match results based on historical data.

## Methodology
In this project, we utilized the XGBoost algorithm for predicting soccer match outcomes. XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in handling complex tabular data and producing accurate predictions.

## Data Preparation
To train our model, we performed data preprocessing and feature engineering to extract meaningful information from the raw dataset. This involved cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.

## Model Building
Using the preprocessed data, we trained an XGBoost model to predict the results of soccer matches. XGBoost's ability to handle high-dimensional data and capture complex relationships between features makes it a suitable choice for this task.

## Evaluation
We evaluated the performance of our model using multiple evaluation metrics, including:

ROC Curve: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve visually represents the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate, allowing us to assess the model's discrimination ability.

F1 Score: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.

Precision: Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total predicted positive instances, indicating the model's accuracy in predicting positive outcomes.

Recall: Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positive instances that were correctly predicted.

Accuracy: Accuracy is the overall correctness of the model's predictions, representing the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances.

These evaluation metrics offer a comprehensive view of the model's performance from different angles, considering both the positive and negative predictions.

The results of these evaluation metrics, including the ROC curve, F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy, can be found in the associated files of this repository.
